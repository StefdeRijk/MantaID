# MantaID
This program is being developed for the manta ID science program at Barefoot Conservation.

The aim of this program is to have an algorithm go through the database and show the most comparable manta rays compared to the picture that you took.
Furthermore, this program makes it easier to go through the database and compare manta ray photos with each other.
This program also makes it easy to add new manta ray individuals to the database.

This program should make it a lot easier and faster for the scientists to organize all the data of the local manta ray populations.
